# These variables are declared by travis automatically or
# in the .travis.yml. I have not found a way to make travis-ci
# share environment variables declared in one shell script with
# other shell scripts in the same build, so for local builds
# they need to be declared also here. 
# THIS IMPLIES THAT THIS LOCAL BUILD AND THE TRAVIS-CI BUILD
# MIGHT DIFFER. TO-DO: IF THIS BUILD STRUCTURE IS KEPT, A
# SCRIPT THAT BUILDS BOTH THIS SCRIPT AND .TRAVIS.YML FROM
# A SET OF COMMON VARIABLES COULD BE USEFUL.
